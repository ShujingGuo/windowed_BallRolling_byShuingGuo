# windowed_BallRolling
- **An interactive Ball Rolling Scoring game playing system.**
- **The MainCamera follows the GameObject's view of the ball and players can use the "w", "a", "s", "d" key on the keyboard to control the direction of the ball's movement.**
- **When the ball touches the square Food, it will eat it, the value of the score on the right-top corner will +1. When the ball eats all the food, the scene displays "Yeah! Victory!!!‚Äù**
- **The whole process simulates the physical collision of actual objects.**
- **[üåü Live Demo üåü](See the short video [here](https://streamja.com/vdmBG))  (only works on Desktop Chrome / Edge)**
